Create an LLM Agent Capable of Math and Machine Learning Operations, Using the OpenAI API


You are an AI engineer working at a financial services firm. Your financial analysts want to use modern large language models as a tool, but need access to mathematical and regression tools that LLMâ€™s are not natively skilled at. Your manager has asked you to prototype an LLM agent solution, coding directly against the OpenAI chat completions API, that augments a chatbot with local tools capable of performing basic mathematical operations and linear regression. Your LLM agent will be evaluated by its ability to successfully compute math and regression problems given as natural language prompts.
